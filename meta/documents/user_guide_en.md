- Cross-selling: each user will receive product recommendations that complement the one they are watching during the current session
- Up-selling: recommendations of products similar to the one being viewed but with a higher price
- Similar products: recommendation frame will display to the user products that are most often displayed by other users, together with the products currently viewed
- Previously viewed: recommendation frame will display to the user products they previously viewed during the current session
- Abandoned cart: recommendation frame will display to the user products that were added to their cart last time but were not purchased
